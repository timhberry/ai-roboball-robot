# Challenges

If you really want to show off, here are some challenging suggestions for how to improve the robot's behaviour:

* The algorithm to search for the ball is very basic, are there better patterns that could be used and how would you implement them?
* Likewise, the solution to line up with the goal and kick the ball is very simplistic in our solution, can you improve upon it?
* Can you implement a behaviour that allows the robot to act upon seeing its opponent? Perhaps it should attempt to move away (particularly if its holding the ball)
* Maybe the robot could act differently if it sees the opponent player _and_ the ball in the same location in its camera? This would suggest the opponent has the ball, so maybe it should attemnpt to tackle!
